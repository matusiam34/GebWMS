# GebWMS

GebWMS aims to be a tiny and feature rich warehouse / inventory management system for smaller operations, but most importantly GebWMS is a system that does not live in the clouds. FYI: Geb is an Egyptian God of Earth.

Here are the main goals of the project:

- build from ground up to be a self-hosted solution aka not cloud based,
- be hardware agnostic which basically means that as long as the device can run a modern-ish web browser you are good to go,
- no vendor lock-ins or licenses required,
- no limits on the amount of locations, daily transactions, SKUs etc

GebWMS will never compete with the established big boy enterprise systems that are available on the market today. The goal is to provide a solution for businesses that need something entry level (that can be installed within the business = none of that cloud stuff) and do not have Â£50k+ to casually spend on a tool to manage their inventory.

I am not using any MVC framework here as I am not sure if it is worth adding such a massive overhead for a tiny system like this. Unless you have some kind of lightweight recommendation. For my CSS needs I am using Bulma since it is easy to use and tiny.

I keep a register of all the changes and added features here:
