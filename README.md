# GebWMS
GebWMS is envisioned as a compact yet feature-rich warehouse and inventory management system tailored for smaller-scale operations. Notably, GebWMS distinguishes itself by being a self-contained solution, devoid of cloud-based dependencies.

The primary objectives of this project encompass:

Development from the ground up as a self-hosted solution, avoiding reliance on cloud infrastructure.
Hardware agnosticism, meaning compatibility with any device capable of running a contemporary web browser.
Freedom from vendor lock-ins or licensing fees, ensuring perpetual free usage.
Absence of constraints on the number of locations, daily transactions, SKUs, and similar parameters.

This project is open-source and is likely to soon be available in the form of a downloadable virtual machine, simplifying deployment and obviating the complexities typically associated with implementation.

It is essential to emphasize that GebWMS does not aspire to compete with established enterprise systems prevalent in the current market. Instead, its mission is to cater to businesses seeking an entry-level inventory management solution that can be deployed within their premises, without the reliance on cloud-based infrastructure, and without the need for substantial financial investment (e.g., Â£50k+).
